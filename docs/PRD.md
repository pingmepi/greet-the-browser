# T-Shirt Design & Ordering Platform - Product Requirements Document

**Date**: 2025-04-04\
**Author**: [Your Name]\
**Status**: Work in Progress

## Overview

A personalized t-shirt design and ordering platform that enables users to create custom apparel through a dynamic, AI-assisted design flow with editable previews. Built for manual fulfillment today, the system is modular to enable automated printing and shipping tomorrow. The architecture will follow a modular design approach, allowing key components such as the design engine, fulfillment service, or payment gateway to be swapped or upgraded independently. The landing page will act as an entry point showcasing pre-designed templates. Users can preview these on various t-shirt colors before entering the design flow.

## Problem Statement

Users lack an intuitive platform to easily design, personalize, and order printed t-shirts with a smooth design experience and reliable fulfillment.

## Success Metrics

- % users who complete a design
- % design -> order conversions
- Manual fulfillment turnaround time
- Order feedback (CSAT)

## User Stories

```
As a customer
I want to answer a few simple design questions
So that I can create a personalized t-shirt that reflects my style

As a customer
I want a dashboard that shows a draft of a design (only give one draft option) to edit the generated design through a visual editor
So that I can personalize the output to match my preferences

As an admin
I want to manage, fulfill, and track orders
So that I can ensure smooth delivery and customer satisfaction
```

## Functional Requirements

### Must Have
 Landing page showcasing pre-designed t-shirts to inspire users

 T-shirt color selector to preview templates on different colors (e.g., black, white, grey)

 User authentication with email/password
 as V1, keep the signup/signin flow simpla:
 - user enters email and password
 - if the details already exist in the database, the user has successfully logged in
 - if details do not exist, throw error "incorrect username/password"
 - highlight "signup instead" button
 - if the user clicks on signup, reload the page and take user details to create a new user. 
 - details required in the signup form are name, email, and password 
 - once the user completes the signup flow, redirect them to login again

 Role-based access control (Customer, Admin)

 Theme selection view with ~15 predefined themes shown as cards/toggles

 API integration to fetch 5 context-relevant questions based on selected themes

 Step-by-step question flow with one question shown at a time and a progress bar

 If the user is not logged in now, then a sign-up pop-up should be shown.

 Once the user logs in, the design created from the previous step should be available on the user's landing page. 

 Capture and store all user responses to questions

 Generate a preview design based on question inputs (via model/API)

 Allow users to edit the generated design using a visual editor (fabric.js)

 Store the original model-generated image and the final user-edited image

 Maintain metadata: themes, user responses, editor actions, timestamps

 Enable design reordering from saved history

 Collect shipping details including phone, address, and pin code. This can also be edited from the user profile in user dashboard. 

 Integrate payments using Razorpay or Stripe

 Create orders with status tracking (pending, printing, shipped, delivered)

 User dashboard to view saved designs and past orders

 Admin dashboard to manage and update order statuses

 Basic support section with contact number

 Track question usage statistics for analytics and improvement

## Dependencies

- Supabase (Auth, DB, Storage)
- Razorpay/Stripe
- fabric.js / Konva.js for design engine
- Vercel (Hosting)

## Timeline

- Phase 1: Core auth, theme-based design flow, preview & editor setup
- Phase 2: Checkout, payment integration, and order management
- Phase 3: Admin panel, design history, fulfillment hooks

## Open Questions

- How can the modularity of each system component be maintained for long-term flexibility and scalability?

- How are designs versioned for edits post-order?
  → All orders are saved in a table with a reference to the specific version of the design used. When the user returns to reorder, designs from their order history are displayed, ensuring consistency and traceability.

- What criteria define 'user style' for personalization? 

- How will automated vendor APIs be integrated later?


## Security Considerations

- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies ensure users can only access their own designs and orders
- Admin roles have controlled access to manage questions and view order statistics
- Authentication tokens are properly managed with appropriate expiration and refresh
- User style metadata is stored securely and used only for enhancing personalization

## Performance Optimization

- Questions are cached to reduce database load
- Question usage statistics are updated asynchronously
- Design previews are optimized for fast loading
- Proper error handling prevents system failures during peak loads

## Accessibility Requirements

- All form inputs include proper aria labels
- Color inputs support both visual selection and text entry
- Progress indicators use both color and text to show completion status
- Error messages are clear and provide actionable information
